# First Rat Client
 Rat Client in Collaboration with [HoverCatz](https://github.com/HoverCatz/).  
 Made for educational purposes in Python using PyCharm.  
 This client works in relation with the [RatClient](https://github.com/1MagicDev1/RatServer).  
 Any IPs located within the code are not related to anyone's network but just out of safety, don't run the program unless you know what you are doing.
